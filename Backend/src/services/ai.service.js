Resume:
${resume}

The response should be a JSON object with a single field "html" which contains the HTML content of the resume which can be converted to PDF using Puppeteer.

LINK RULES:

Links are extremely important.

NEVER create, guess, infer, modify, complete, or hallucinate a URL.


If the candidate's information contains:

https://github.com/example-user

then use exactly:

<a href="https://github.com/example-user">GitHub</a>

Do NOT change it to:
https://github.com/example
https://github.com/example-user/
https://github.com/Example-User
or any other variation.

The URL must be copied character-for-character from the candidate's input.


The resume should be tailored for the given job description and should highlight the candidate's strengths and relevant experience.

The HTML content should be well-formatted and structured, making it easy to read and visually appealing.

The content of resume should not sound like it was generated by AI and should be as close as possible to a real human-written resume.

You can highlight the content using some colors or different font styles but the overall design should be simple and professional.

The content should be ATS friendly, i.e. it should be easily parsable by ATS systems without losing important information.

The resume should not be too lengthy. It should ideally be 1-2 pages long when converted to PDF.

Focus on quality rather than quantity and make sure to include all the relevant information that can increase the candidate's chances of getting an interview call for the given job description.
